# Hemlock-Renderer-Opengl-3D-Renderer
Re-committed as a new repo to clean up the code and to continue developping.
Hemlock Renderer is a personal project I've been working on for the past two months. It's an Opengl based 3D renderer written in C++. Currently doesn't support PBR workflow but soon enough it will ;). 
This is how it currently looks(Tank Model doesn't belong to me):
