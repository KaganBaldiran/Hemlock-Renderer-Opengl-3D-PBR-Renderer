# Hemlock-Renderer-Opengl-3D-Renderer
Hemlock Renderer is an Opengl based 3D PBR renderer written in C++.
Still is in an early stage of development and requires a considerable amount of work in order to bring it to life completely.
I'm mostly following widely used techniques and algorithms.

# Features

I'm trying to widen up the feature arsenal as much as can . But also trying to fix the known bugs.
Here are some of the key features

- Multi-object PBR workflow
- IBL support
- SSAO
- HDRI support along with simple cubemaps.
- Screen based post processing(DOF etc)
- Linear Shadow Mapping for directional lights(Soon to be replaced)
- Omnidirectional shadow mapping for point lights
- Native scene file save-read
- Drop down file import-assign

# To-Do

- Widely supported light types in shadow mapping 
- Area Lights
- Screen space global illumination
- Ray marched volume rendering 
- Node support for material authuring(Long term goal)

# Showcase
This is how it currently looks(Some of the models don't belong to me):
